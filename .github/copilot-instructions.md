# PolyPilot — Copilot Instructions

## Build & Deploy Commands

### Mac Catalyst (primary dev target)
```bash
./relaunch.sh              # Build + async hot-relaunch (ALWAYS use this after code changes)
./relaunch.sh --sync       # Build + blocking relaunch (for interactive terminal use only)
dotnet build -f net10.0-maccatalyst   # Build only
```

#### ⚠️ Relaunch from a Copilot agent session

`relaunch.sh` is **async by default** — it returns immediately after a successful build, then kills the old UI and launches the new one in a detached background process after a 10-second delay. This is critical because PolyPilot hosts the Copilot sessions via TCP to the persistent CLI server. If the script blocked and killed the UI synchronously, the TCP connection would drop mid-tool-call and the agent's turn would be interrupted.

> **🚨 RULES FOR CALLING RELAUNCH.SH 🚨**
> 1. Do NOT chain ANYTHING after `./relaunch.sh` in the same bash call — no `&&`, `;`, `|`, `sleep`.
> 2. You have ~10 seconds after relaunch.sh returns to make additional quick tool calls
>    (e.g., `maui-devflow wait`, `tail`, short verification commands). Use this window
>    to keep working — verify the relaunch, reconnect to MauiDevFlow, test your changes.
> 3. If one tool call gets interrupted by the kill, that's OK — the CLI keeps your session
>    alive. Just continue on the next turn.
> 4. Do NOT make long-running tool calls (>8s) after relaunch — they will be interrupted.

**Correct pattern — keep working after relaunch:**
```bash
# Tool call 1: relaunch (returns immediately after build)
./relaunch.sh
```
After relaunch.sh returns, the old UI will be killed in ~10s and a new one launched.
Your turn may get interrupted if a tool call is in-flight when the kill happens — that's OK,
the CLI keeps your session alive. On your next turn, verify and continue:
```bash
# Next turn: verify relaunch + reconnect to MauiDevFlow
tail -3 ~/.polypilot/relaunch.log && maui-devflow wait --timeout 30
```
```bash
# Then test your changes via CDP
maui-devflow cdp Runtime evaluate '...'
```

**NEVER do this:**
```bash
# ❌ WRONG — chaining in the same bash call blocks the tool return
./relaunch.sh && sleep 15 && cat ~/.polypilot/relaunch.log

# ❌ WRONG — sleep/long commands chained after relaunch
./relaunch.sh; sleep 10; tail ~/.polypilot/relaunch.log
```

The `--sync` flag restores the old blocking behavior (for human terminal use only — NEVER use from an agent).

### Tests
```bash
cd ../PolyPilot.Tests && dotnet test              # Run all tests
cd ../PolyPilot.Tests && dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ChatMessageTests"  # Run one test class
cd ../PolyPilot.Tests && dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ChatMessageTests.UserMessage_SetsRoleAndType"  # Single test
```
The test project lives at `../PolyPilot.Tests/` (sibling directory). It includes source files from the main project via `<Compile Include>` links because the MAUI project can't be directly referenced from a plain `net10.0` test project. When adding new model or utility classes, add a corresponding `<Compile Include>` entry to the test csproj if the file has no MAUI dependencies.

**Always run tests after modifying models, bridge messages, or serialization logic.** When adding new features or changing existing behavior, update or add tests to match. The tests serve as a living specification of the app's data contracts and parsing logic.

> ⚠️ **Zero tolerance for test failures.** When you encounter test failures — whether caused by your changes or pre-existing — **always fix them**. Never dismiss failures as "pre-existing" or "unrelated". If tests fail, they must be fixed before the task is complete. A green test suite is a hard requirement for every PR.
>
> **For worker/implementer agents specifically:** You are NEVER allowed to report a test failure as "pre-existing" and move on. If you discover a test failure that existed before your change, you must still fix it as part of your task. Saying "pre-existing failure, not caused by my changes" without fixing it is a task failure. Fix the test or fix the production code — whichever is correct — then verify the suite is green.

### Android
```bash
dotnet build -f net10.0-android                  # Build only
dotnet build -f net10.0-android -t:Install       # Build + deploy to connected device (use this, not bare `adb install`)
adb shell am start -n com.microsoft.PolyPilot/crc64ef8e1bf56c865459.MainActivity   # Launch
```
Fast Deployment requires `dotnet build -t:Install` — it pushes assemblies to `.__override__` on device.

> ⚠️ **WiFi ADB on macOS**: Do NOT use `adb kill-server` (wipes TLS pairing keys; proxy dies).
> Build with `-p:EmbedAssembliesIntoApk=true` for WiFi deploy (Fast Deployment APKs are stale).
> macOS firewall blocks ADB's outbound TLS — a Python TCP proxy is required.
> **Full playbook**: `.claude/skills/android-wifi-deploy/SKILL.md`

**Package name**: `com.microsoft.PolyPilot` (not `com.companyname.PolyPilot`)  
**Launch activity**: `crc64ef8e1bf56c865459.MainActivity`

### Windows
```powershell
dotnet build -f net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0       # Build only
dotnet run -f net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0          # Build + launch
```

#### ⚠️ Relaunch from a Copilot agent session (Windows)

`relaunch.ps1` kills **both** PolyPilot.exe **and** copilot.exe (the persistent CLI server)
before building. When the auto-update service calls it, PowerShell is a direct child of
PolyPilot.exe, so killing the copilot server is harmless to the script's process tree.

However, when a **Copilot agent** runs `relaunch.ps1`, the process chain is:
`PolyPilot → copilot.exe (server) → [agent tool PowerShell] → relaunch.ps1`.
The script kills `copilot.exe` — the agent's own parent process — breaking stdio pipes
and terminating the tool call before the build/relaunch can complete.

> **🚨 RULES FOR CALLING RELAUNCH.PS1 FROM AN AGENT SESSION 🚨**
> 1. **NEVER** run `relaunch.ps1` directly (e.g., `powershell -File relaunch.ps1`).
>    It will kill your host process and the script will not complete.
> 2. **ALWAYS** launch it as a fully detached process using `Start-Process`:
>    ```powershell
>    Start-Process powershell.exe -ArgumentList "-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File `"C:\Projects\PolyPilot\PolyPilot\relaunch.ps1`"" -WindowStyle Normal
>    ```
>    This spawns PowerShell outside the copilot process tree so it survives the kill.
> 3. After launching, your session will be interrupted when PolyPilot is killed (~2s later).
>    That's expected — the new instance will start within ~30s and your session resumes.
> 4. Do NOT attempt to verify the relaunch from the same turn — your session will be dead.

### iOS (physical device)
```bash
dotnet build -f net10.0-ios -r ios-arm64         # Build only
xcrun devicectl device install app --device <UDID> bin/Debug/net10.0-ios/ios-arm64/PolyPilot.app/
xcrun devicectl device process launch --device <UDID> com.companyname.PolyPilot
```
Do NOT use `dotnet build -t:Run` for physical iOS — it hangs waiting for the app to exit.

### iOS Simulator
```bash
dotnet build -f net10.0-ios -t:Run -p:_DeviceName=:v2:udid=<UDID>
```

### MauiDevFlow (UI inspection & debugging)
The app integrates `Redth.MauiDevFlow.Agent` + `Redth.MauiDevFlow.Blazor` for remote UI inspection. See `.claude/skills/maui-ai-debugging/SKILL.md` for the full command reference.
```bash
maui-devflow MAUI status           # Agent connection
maui-devflow cdp status            # CDP/Blazor WebView
maui-devflow MAUI tree             # Visual tree
maui-devflow cdp snapshot          # DOM snapshot (best for AI)
maui-devflow MAUI logs             # Application ILogger output
```
For Android, always run `adb reverse tcp:9223 tcp:9223` after deploy.

## Architecture

**See `docs/multi-agent-orchestration.md` for the multi-agent architecture spec** (orchestration modes, reflection loop, sentinel protocol, invariants, Squad integration). Test scenarios in `PolyPilot.Tests/Scenarios/multi-agent-scenarios.json`. Read these before modifying orchestration, reconciliation, or TCS completion logic.

### Squad Integration
PolyPilot discovers [bradygaster/squad](https://github.com/bradygaster/squad) team definitions from `.squad/` (or legacy `.ai-team/`) directories in the worktree root. Each agent's `charter.md` becomes a worker system prompt, `team.md` defines the roster, `decisions.md` provides shared context injected into all worker prompts, and `routing.md` is injected into the orchestrator's planning prompt. Repo-level teams appear in a **"📂 From Repo"** section in the preset picker, above built-in presets.

**Squad write-back:** When saving a multi-agent group as a preset, PolyPilot writes the team definition back to `.squad/` format in the worktree root via `SquadWriter`. This creates `team.md`, `agents/{name}/charter.md`, and optional `decisions.md`/`routing.md`. The preset is also saved to `presets.json` as a personal backup. This enables round-tripping: discover → modify → save back → share via repo.

**Preset priority (three-tier merge):** Built-in presets are always shown and cannot be overridden. User presets (`~/.polypilot/presets.json`) and repo teams (`.squad/`) with the same name as a built-in are skipped. The preset picker shows three sections: "📂 From Repo" (with delete button), "⚙️ Built-in", and "👤 My Presets".

**Group deletion:** Deleting a multi-agent team closes and removes all its sessions (they're meaningless without the team). Deleting a regular group moves sessions to the default group.

This is a .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid app targeting Mac Catalyst, Android, and iOS. It manages multiple GitHub Copilot CLI sessions through a native GUI.

### Three-Layer Stack
1. **Blazor UI** (`Components/`) — Razor components rendered in a BlazorWebView. All styling is CSS in `wwwroot/app.css` and scoped `.razor.css` files.
2. **Service Layer** (`Services/`) — `CopilotService` (singleton) manages sessions via `ConcurrentDictionary<string, SessionState>`. Events from the SDK arrive on background threads and are marshaled to the UI thread via `SynchronizationContext.Post`.
3. **SDK** — `GitHub.Copilot.SDK` (`CopilotClient`/`CopilotSession`) communicates with the Copilot CLI process via ACP (Agent Control Protocol) over stdio or TCP.

### Connection Modes
- **Embedded** (fallback): SDK spawns copilot via stdio, dies with app.
- **Persistent** (default on desktop): App spawns a detached `copilot --headless` server tracked via PID file; survives restarts.
- **Remote**: Connects to a remote server URL (e.g., DevTunnel). Only mode available on mobile.
- **Demo**: Local mock responses for testing without a network connection.

Mode and CLI source selections persist immediately to `~/.polypilot/settings.json` when the user clicks the corresponding card — no "Save & Reconnect" needed for the choice itself. "Save & Reconnect" is only needed to actually reconnect with the new settings.

### Mode Switching & Session Persistence
When switching between Embedded and Persistent modes (via Settings → Save & Reconnect), `ReconnectAsync` tears down the existing client and restores sessions from disk. Key safety mechanisms:

1. **Merge-based `SaveActiveSessionsToDisk()`** — reads the existing `active-sessions.json` and preserves entries whose session directory still exists on disk, even if not currently in memory. This prevents partial restores from clobbering the full list. The merge logic is in `CopilotService.Persistence.cs` → `MergeSessionEntries()` (static, testable).

2. **`_closedSessionIds`** — tracks sessions explicitly closed by the user so the merge doesn't re-add them. Cleared on `ReconnectAsync`.

3. **`IsRestoring` flag** — set during `RestorePreviousSessionsAsync`. Guards per-session `SaveActiveSessionsToDisk()` and `ReconcileOrganization()` calls to avoid unnecessary disk I/O and race conditions during bulk restore.

4. **Persistent fallback notice** — if `InitializeAsync` can't start the persistent server, it falls back to Embedded and sets `FallbackNotice` with a visible warning banner on the Dashboard.

### WebSocket Bridge (Remote Viewer Protocol)
`WsBridgeServer` runs on the desktop app and exposes session state over WebSocket. `WsBridgeClient` runs on mobile apps to receive live updates and send commands. The protocol is defined in `Models/BridgeMessages.cs` with typed payloads and message type constants in `BridgeMessageTypes`.

`DevTunnelService` manages a `devtunnel host` process to expose the bridge over the internet, with QR code scanning for easy mobile setup (`QrScannerPage.xaml`).

### Platform Differences
`Models/PlatformHelper.cs` exposes `IsDesktop`/`IsMobile` and controls which `ConnectionMode`s are available. Mobile can only use Remote mode. Desktop defaults to Persistent.

**Mobile-only behavior:**
- Desktop menu items (Fix with Copilot, Copilot Console, Terminal, VS Code) are hidden via `PlatformHelper.IsDesktop` guards in `SessionListItem.razor`.
- Report Bug opens the browser with a pre-filled GitHub issue URL via `Launcher.Default.OpenAsync` instead of the inline sidebar form.
- Processing status indicator shows elapsed time and tool round count, synced via bridge.

**Editor preference:**
- `Editor` setting (`VsCodeVariant.Stable`/`Insiders`) in `ConnectionSettings` controls which VS Code binary (`code`/`code-insiders`) is launched from session context menus.
- Configurable in Settings → UI → Editor (desktop only). Persists in `settings.json`.

## Critical Conventions

### Build & Launch
- **NEVER use `--no-build`** when running the app (`dotnet run`). Always do a full build to catch and fix compile errors before launching. Using `--no-build` can cause silent crashes from stale binaries.

### Git Workflow
- **NEVER commit or push directly to `main`** — always create a feature branch and open a PR, even for single-line fixes. Use `git checkout -b <branch> origin/main` to create the branch, make your changes, push the branch, then open a PR. No exceptions.
- **NEVER use `git push --force`** — always use `git push --force-with-lease` instead when a force push is needed (e.g., after a rebase). This prevents overwriting remote changes made by others.
- **NEVER commit screenshots, images, or binary files** — use `git diff --stat` or `git status` before committing to verify no `.png`, `.jpg`, `.bmp`, or other image files are staged. Screenshots from PolyPilot (e.g., `screenshot_*.png`) are generated locally and must NEVER be committed. The `.gitignore` blocks common patterns, but always double-check.
- **NEVER use `git add -A` or `git add .` blindly** — always review what's being staged first with `git status`. Prefer `git add <specific-files>` when possible to avoid accidentally committing generated files.
- **When creating a new branch for a PR**, always base it on `upstream/main` (or `origin/main`). Do NOT branch from whatever HEAD happens to be — the repo may be on a feature branch. Use `git checkout -b <branch> upstream/main`. After creating the branch, verify with `git log --oneline upstream/main..HEAD` that only your commits appear.
- **NEVER use `git commit --amend`** unless the user explicitly asks for it. Always add new commits on top. This preserves history so reviewers and other agents can see what changed between iterations.
- When contributing to an existing PR, prefer adding commits on top. Rebase only when explicitly asked.
- Use `git add -f` when adding files matched by `.gitignore` patterns (e.g., `*.app/` catches `PolyPilot/`).

### No `static readonly` fields that call platform APIs
`static readonly` fields are evaluated during type initialization — before MAUI's platform layer is ready on Android/iOS. This causes `TypeInitializationException` crashes.

**Always use lazy properties instead:**
```csharp
// ❌ WRONG — crashes on Android/iOS
private static readonly string MyPath = Path.Combine(FileSystem.AppDataDirectory, "file.json");

// ✅ CORRECT — deferred until first access
private static string? _myPath;
private static string MyPath => _myPath ??= Path.Combine(FileSystem.AppDataDirectory, "file.json");
```

This applies to `FileSystem.AppDataDirectory`, `Environment.GetFolderPath()`, and any Android/iOS-specific API. See `CopilotService.cs` (lines 19-59) and `ConnectionSettings.cs` (lines 29-53) for examples.

### File paths on iOS/Android vs desktop
- **Desktop**: Use `Environment.SpecialFolder.UserProfile` → `~/.copilot/`
- **iOS/Android**: Use `FileSystem.AppDataDirectory` (persistent across restarts). `Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData` on iOS resolves to a cache directory that can be purged.
- Always wrap in try/catch with `Path.GetTempPath()` fallback.

### Linker / Trimmer
`<TrimmerRootAssembly Include="GitHub.Copilot.SDK" />` in the csproj prevents the linker from stripping SDK event types needed for runtime pattern matching. Do NOT remove this.

### Mac Catalyst Sandbox
Disabled in `Platforms/MacCatalyst/Entitlements.plist` — required for spawning copilot CLI processes and binding network ports.

### Edge-to-edge on Android (.NET 10)
.NET 10 MAUI defaults `ContentPage.SafeAreaEdges` to `None` (edge-to-edge). For this Blazor app, safe area insets are handled entirely in CSS/JS — do NOT set `SafeAreaEdges="Container"` on MainPage.xaml or add `padding-bottom` on body, as this causes double-padding.

### SDK Event Flow
When a prompt is sent, the SDK emits events processed by `HandleSessionEvent` in order:
1. `SessionUsageInfoEvent` → server acknowledged, sets `ProcessingPhase=1`
2. `AssistantTurnStartEvent` → model generating, sets `ProcessingPhase=2`
3. `AssistantMessageDeltaEvent` → streaming content chunks
4. `AssistantMessageEvent` → full message (may include tool requests)
5. `ToolExecutionStartEvent` → tool activity starts, sets `ProcessingPhase=3`, increments `ToolCallCount` on complete
6. `ToolExecutionCompleteEvent` → tool done, increments `ToolCallCount`
7. `AssistantIntentEvent` → intent/plan updates
8. `AssistantTurnEndEvent` → end of a sub-turn, tool loop continues. `FlushCurrentResponse` persists accumulated text before the next sub-turn.
9. `SessionIdleEvent` → turn complete, response finalized. **Unless** `Data.BackgroundTasks` has active agents/shells — then flushes text, logs `[IDLE-DEFER]`, and keeps `IsProcessing=true` (PR #399).

### Processing Status Indicator
`AgentSessionInfo` tracks three fields for the processing status UI:
- `ProcessingStartedAt` (DateTime?) — set to `DateTime.UtcNow` in `SendPromptAsync`
- `ToolCallCount` (int) — incremented on each `ToolExecutionCompleteEvent`
- `ProcessingPhase` (int) — 0=Sending, 1=ServerConnected, 2=Thinking, 3=Working

All three are reset in `SendPromptAsync` (new turn) and cleared in `CompleteResponse` (turn done) and `AbortSessionAsync` (user stop). They're synced to mobile via `SessionSummary` in the bridge protocol.

The UI shows: "Sending…" → "Server connected…" → "Thinking…" → "Working · Xm Xs · N tool calls…".

### Abort Behavior
`AbortSessionAsync` must clear ALL processing state — see `.claude/skills/processing-state-safety/SKILL.md` for the full cleanup checklist and the paths that clear `IsProcessing`.

### ⚠️ IsProcessing Cleanup Invariant
**CRITICAL**: Every code path that sets `IsProcessing = false` must clear 9 companion fields and call `FlushCurrentResponse`. This is the most recurring bug category (13 PRs of fix/regression cycles). **Read `.claude/skills/processing-state-safety/SKILL.md` before modifying ANY processing path.** There are 15+ such paths across CopilotService.cs, Events.cs, Bridge.cs, Organization.cs, and Providers.cs.

### Content Persistence
`FlushCurrentResponse` is also called on `AssistantTurnEndEvent` to persist accumulated response text at each sub-turn boundary. This prevents content loss if the app restarts between `turn_end` and `session.idle` (e.g., "zero-idle sessions" where the SDK never emits `session.idle`). The flush includes a dedup guard to prevent duplicate messages from event replay on resume.

### Processing Watchdog
The processing watchdog (`RunProcessingWatchdogAsync` in `CopilotService.Events.cs`) detects stuck sessions by checking how long since the last SDK event. It checks every 15 seconds and has three timeout tiers:
- **30 seconds** (resume quiescence) — for resumed sessions with zero SDK events since restart. Assumes the turn already finished before the restart. **Bypassed** when the events file shows recent activity (< 120s old) — in that case, the session was genuinely active and gets the longer timeout.
- **120 seconds** (inactivity timeout) — for sessions with no tool activity
- **600 seconds** (tool execution timeout) — used when ANY of these are true:
  - A tool call is actively running (`ActiveToolCallCount > 0`)
  - The session was resumed mid-turn after app restart (`IsResumed`)
  - Tools have been used this turn (`HasUsedToolsThisTurn`) — even between tool rounds when the model is thinking

For multi-agent sessions, Case B also checks **file-size-growth**: if events.jsonl hasn't grown for `WatchdogCaseBMaxStaleChecks` (2) consecutive deferrals, the session is force-completed — the connection is dead. This catches `ConnectionLostException` scenarios where mtime stays fresh but no new data arrives, reducing detection from 30+ min to ~360s (3 cycles: 1 baseline + 2 stale checks). The 1800s freshness window is preserved.

Note: Some sessions never receive `session.idle` events (SDK/CLI bug). In these "zero-idle" cases, `IsProcessing` is only cleared by the watchdog or user abort. The turn_end flush (see Content Persistence above) ensures response content is not lost.

When the watchdog fires, it marshals state mutations to the UI thread via `InvokeOnUI()` and adds a system warning message.

### Diagnostic Log Tags
The event diagnostics log (`~/.polypilot/event-diagnostics.log`) uses these tags:
- `[SEND]` — prompt sent, IsProcessing set to true
- `[EVT]` — SDK event received (only SessionIdleEvent, AssistantTurnEndEvent, SessionErrorEvent)
- `[IDLE]` — SessionIdleEvent dispatched to CompleteResponse
- `[IDLE-DEFER]` — SessionIdleEvent deferred due to active background tasks (agents/shells)
- `[COMPLETE]` — CompleteResponse executed or skipped
- `[RECONNECT]` — session replaced after disconnect
- `[ERROR]` — SessionErrorEvent or SendAsync/reconnect failure cleared IsProcessing
- `[ABORT]` — user-initiated abort cleared IsProcessing
- `[BRIDGE-COMPLETE]` — bridge OnTurnEnd cleared IsProcessing
- `[INTERRUPTED]` — app restart detected interrupted turn (watchdog timeout after resume)
- `[WATCHDOG]` — watchdog clearing IsResumed or timing out a stuck session

Every code path that sets `IsProcessing = false` MUST have a diagnostic log entry. This is critical for debugging stuck-session issues.

### Thread Safety: IsProcessing Mutations
All mutations to `state.Info.IsProcessing` must be marshaled to the UI thread. SDK events arrive on background threads. Use `InvokeOnUI()` (not bare `Invoke()`) to combine state mutation + notification in a single callback. Key patterns:
- **CompleteResponse**: Already runs on UI thread (dispatched via `Invoke()`)
- **Watchdog callback**: Uses `InvokeOnUI()` with generation guard
- **SessionErrorEvent**: Uses `InvokeOnUI()` to combine OnError + IsProcessing + OnStateChanged
- **Resume fallback**: Removed (watchdog handles it)
- **SendAsync error paths**: Run on UI thread inline (in SendPromptAsync's catch blocks)

### Model Selection
The model is set at **session creation time** via `SessionConfig.Model`. The SDK does **not** support changing models per-message or mid-session — `MessageOptions` has no `Model` property. 

When a user changes the model via the UI dropdown:
- `session.Model` is updated locally (affects UI display only)
- The SDK continues using the original model from session creation
- To truly switch models, the session must be destroyed and recreated

### SDK Data Types
- `AssistantUsageData` properties (`InputTokens`, `OutputTokens`, etc.) are `Double?` not `int?`
- Use `Convert.ToInt32(value)` for conversion, not `value as int?`
- `QuotaSnapshots` is `Dictionary<string, object>` with `JsonElement` values
- Premium quota fields: `isUnlimitedEntitlement`, `entitlementRequests`, `usedRequests`, `remainingPercentage`, `resetDate`

### Blazor Input Performance
Avoid `@bind:event="oninput"` — causes round-trip lag per keystroke. Use plain HTML inputs with JS event listeners and read values via `JS.InvokeAsync<string>("eval", "document.getElementById('id')?.value")` on submit.

### Render Performance
`SaveActiveSessionsToDisk`, `SaveOrganization`, and `SaveUiState` use timer-based debounce (2s/2s/1s) — **must flush in DisposeAsync**. `LoadPersistedSessions()` scans all session directories (750+) — **never call from render-triggered paths**. `GetOrganizedSessions()` is cached with hash-key invalidation. `_sessionSwitching` flag must stay true until `SafeRefreshAsync` reads it. See `.claude/skills/performance-optimization/SKILL.md` for detailed invariants.

For detailed stuck-session debugging knowledge (8 invariants from 7 PRs of fix cycles), see `.claude/skills/processing-state-safety/SKILL.md`.

### Session Persistence
- Active sessions: `~/.polypilot/active-sessions.json` (includes `LastPrompt` — last user message if session was processing during save)
- Session state: `~/.copilot/session-state/<guid>/events.jsonl` (SDK-managed, stays in ~/.copilot)
- UI state: `~/.polypilot/ui-state.json`
- Settings: `~/.polypilot/settings.json`
- Crash log: `~/.polypilot/crash.log`
- Organization: `~/.polypilot/organization.json`
- Server PID: `~/.polypilot/server.pid`
- Repos/worktrees: `~/.polypilot/repos.json`, `~/.polypilot/repos/`, `~/.polypilot/worktrees/`

## Remote Mode (WsBridge Protocol)

### Architecture
Mobile apps connect to the desktop server via WebSocket. `WsBridgeServer` runs on desktop (port 4322), `WsBridgeClient` runs on mobile. The protocol is JSON-based state-sync defined in `Models/BridgeMessages.cs`.

### Common Pitfalls for Future Agents

1. **Remote mode operations must be handled separately.** Any `CopilotService` method that touches `state.Session` (the SDK `CopilotSession`) will crash in remote mode because `state.Session` is `null!`. Always check `IsRemoteMode` first and delegate to `_bridgeClient`.

2. **Optimistic adds need full state.** When adding a session optimistically in remote mode (before server confirms), you must:
   - Add to `_sessions` dictionary
   - Add to `_pendingRemoteSessions` (prevents `SyncRemoteSessions` from removing it)
   - Add `SessionMeta` to `Organization.Sessions` (or `GetOrganizedSessions()` won't render it)
   - Do all this BEFORE awaiting the bridge send (race condition with server response)

3. **Thread safety.** `SyncRemoteSessions` runs on the bridge client's background thread. `_sessions` is `ConcurrentDictionary` (safe). `_pendingRemoteSessions` is `ConcurrentDictionary` (safe). But `Organization.Sessions` is a plain `List<SessionMeta>` — access from the UI thread only.

4. **Adding new bridge commands.** When adding client→server commands:
   - Add a constant to `BridgeMessageTypes` in `BridgeMessages.cs`
   - Add a payload class if needed (or reuse `SessionNamePayload`)
   - Add the send method to `WsBridgeClient`
   - Add a `case` handler in `WsBridgeServer.HandleClientMessage()`
   - Add the remote-mode delegation in `CopilotService`
   - Add tests in `RemoteModeTests.cs`

5. **DevTunnel strips auth headers.** The `X-Tunnel-Authorization` header is consumed by DevTunnel infrastructure. `WsBridgeServer.ValidateClientToken` trusts loopback connections since DevTunnel proxies to localhost after its own auth.

### Test Coverage

Tests include source files via `<Compile Include>` links in the csproj. When adding new model classes, add a corresponding link entry.

### Test Safety

#### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Test File System Isolation
Tests MUST NEVER read from or write to the real `~/.polypilot/` directory. `TestSetup.cs` contains a `[ModuleInitializer]` that calls `CopilotService.SetBaseDirForTesting()` to redirect ALL file I/O (organization.json, active-sessions.json, ui-state.json, etc.) to a per-process temp directory. This runs automatically before any test.

**Why this matters:** Without isolation, tests that call `CreateGroup`, `SaveOrganization`, `FlushSaveActiveSessionsToDisk`, etc. overwrite the user's real data files — destroying squad groups, session metadata, and settings. This caused production data loss (squad groups destroyed) multiple times before the guard was added.

**Guard tests:** `TestIsolationGuardTests.cs` contains 4 tests that verify isolation is active. If any of these fail, ALL other test results are suspect because they may have corrupted real user data.

**When adding new file paths to CopilotService:** You MUST also clear the corresponding backing field in `SetBaseDirForTesting()`, or the new path will leak to the real filesystem.

#### Other test safety rules
- Tests must **NEVER** call `ConnectionSettings.Save()` or `ConnectionSettings.Load()` — these read/write `~/.polypilot/settings.json` which is shared with the running app.
- All tests use `ReconnectAsync(settings)` with an in-memory settings object.
- Never use `ConnectionMode.Embedded` in tests — it spawns real copilot processes. Use `ConnectionMode.Persistent` with port 19999 for deterministic failures, or `ConnectionMode.Demo` for success paths.
- CopilotService dependencies are injected via interfaces: `IChatDatabase`, `IServerManager`, `IWsBridgeClient`, `IDemoService`. Test stubs live in `TestStubs.cs`.
